# Breast-Cancer.

The project that was planned to be undertaken was focused on using logistic regression to predict the probability of breast cancer diagnosis. Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm that is commonly used in healthcare and medical research. The objective of this project was to use this algorithm to accurately predict the likelihood of breast cancer in patients based on a set of input variables.

The data that was to be used for this project was a dataset of patient information, including demographic information, medical history, and test results. The target or dependent variable in this case was the diagnosis of breast cancer, which is dichotomous in nature, meaning there would only be two possible classes: positive or negative using Python, Data Analysis.

The project would have involved preprocessing and cleaning the data, selecting relevant features, and then building and training a logistic regression model using this data. The model would have then been tested using a separate dataset to evaluate its performance and accuracy( Machine Learning).

The project would have then been further extended by exploring different techniques to improve the performance of the model such as regularization, ensemble methods, and feature selection techniques. The final outcome of the project would have been a logistic regression model that could accurately predict the likelihood of breast cancer in patients.

However, due to some reason the project was cancelled but it would have been an interesting and valuable project as it could have helped in early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, ultimately saving lives.
